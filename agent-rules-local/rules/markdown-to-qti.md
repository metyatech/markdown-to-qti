# Project Rules: markdown-to-qti (Kotlin)

## Scope

- This repository will implement a tool that converts Markdown content into IMS QTI 3.0.
- Prioritize correctness of QTI 3.0 output and a clean internal data model.

## Kotlin / Gradle conventions

- Prefer Kotlin (JVM) with Gradle.
- Keep the entrypoint small; put logic into testable functions/classes.
- Favor immutable data, explicit types at boundaries, and clear error types.

## QTI 3.0 output rules

- Output must be valid QTI 3.0 XML (well-formed, schema-aligned).
- Keep identifiers stable and deterministic (avoid random IDs unless explicitly required).
- When behavior is ambiguous, prefer standards-compliant conservative output and document the decision.

## Markdown conversion behavior

- Define supported Markdown features explicitly (e.g., headings, lists, code blocks, inline formatting).
- If a requested Markdown construct cannot be represented in QTI, do not implement it and explicitly state this in the response.
- Unsupported constructs should fail fast with actionable messages, or be safely downgraded with clear warnings.
- Preserve exact formatting as much as possible when mapping to QTI.

## Testing expectations

- Add unit tests for parsing/mapping rules.
- Add golden tests for QTI XML output (compare normalized XML).
- Include a few end-to-end fixtures (Markdown input -> QTI output) under a dedicated test folder.

## CLI / UX

- Provide a simple CLI with:
  - input path(s)
  - output directory
  - validation mode (validate-only)
  - verbose logging
- Error messages must include the source location when possible (file + line/column).
