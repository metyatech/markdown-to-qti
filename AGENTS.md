# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before responding to ANY user message, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, install it via npm: `npm install -g compose-agentsmd`.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Exam Markdown

- When creating or editing exam Markdown, follow the format in
  markdown-to-qti/markdown-question-spec.md.

Source: agent-rules-local/rules/markdown-to-qti.md

# Project Rules: markdown-to-qti (Kotlin)

## Scope

- This repository will implement a tool that converts Markdown content into IMS QTI 3.0.
- Prioritize correctness of QTI 3.0 output and a clean internal data model.

## Kotlin / Gradle conventions

- Prefer Kotlin (JVM) with Gradle.
- Keep the entrypoint small; put logic into testable functions/classes.
- Favor immutable data, explicit types at boundaries, and clear error types.

## QTI 3.0 output rules

- Output must be valid QTI 3.0 XML (well-formed, schema-aligned).
- Keep identifiers stable and deterministic (avoid random IDs unless explicitly required).
- When behavior is ambiguous, prefer standards-compliant conservative output and document the decision.

## Markdown conversion behavior

- Define supported Markdown features explicitly (e.g., headings, lists, code blocks, inline formatting).
- If a requested Markdown construct cannot be represented in QTI, do not implement it and explicitly state this in the response.
- Unsupported constructs should fail fast with actionable messages, or be safely downgraded with clear warnings.
- Preserve exact formatting as much as possible when mapping to QTI.

## Testing expectations

- Add unit tests for parsing/mapping rules.
- Add golden tests for QTI XML output (compare normalized XML).
- Include a few end-to-end fixtures (Markdown input -> QTI output) under a dedicated test folder.

## CLI / UX

- Provide a simple CLI with:
  - input path(s)
  - output directory
  - validation mode (validate-only)
  - verbose logging
- Error messages must include the source location when possible (file + line/column).
