# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before responding to ANY user message, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, run it via `npx compose-agentsmd`. If `npx` is unavailable or cannot fetch the package, install it via npm with an environment-appropriate method such as `npm install -g compose-agentsmd` when global installs are permitted, or a user-local npm prefix when global installs are not permitted.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Exam Markdown

## Common question format

- When creating or editing Markdown questions, quizzes, exams, or preparation
  question sets, use the common Markdown question format below. Small quizzes,
  exams, and preparation question collections share this format.
- markdown-to-qti is the only supported Markdown parser/compiler for question
  Markdown.
- The authoritative human/AI-edited sources are Markdown question files plus a
  manifest. The shared intermediate representation is the generated QTI package.
- Track publish workflows should treat the QTI package as the source artifact
  when publishing support is available.

- 2: ...

## Explanation

...
```

## Question frontmatter and sections

- `question_type` MUST be one of `descriptive`, `choice`, or `cloze`.
- `time_budget_seconds` MUST be present and MUST be a positive integer.
- `time_estimate_seconds` MUST NOT be used.
- `## Type` MUST NOT be used. Put the type in `question_type` frontmatter
  instead.
- Cloze answers MUST use `{{answer}}` for exact answers or `{{/regex/}}` for
  regular-expression answers.
- `${...}` MUST NOT be used for cloze answers or any other answer placeholder.
- Keep educational quality rules in the education domain separate from this
  operational Markdown/QTI format rule.

## Manifest format

- Manifests MUST contain `title` and `items`.
- Manifests MAY contain `time_limit_seconds`.
- Manifest `type: quiz` and `type: exam` MUST NOT be used. Distinguish quiz,
  exam, and preparation-set behavior outside the common manifest schema.
- When `time_limit_seconds` is present, it is the time limit for the entire
  question set.
- When `time_limit_seconds` is absent, the set time budget is the sum of each
  item's `time_budget_seconds`.
- Do not apply weekly quiz-specific fixed-window rules such as
  `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SECONDS` checks to the common format. Keep weekly quiz
  scheduling/publication policy in weekly quiz-specific rules only.

## Legacy tooling

- `convert-exam-md-to-html` is legacy/deprecated. Do not use it for new
  Markdown question compilation, validation, preview, or publication flows.
- Migrate existing workflows toward `markdown-to-qti` output and QTI packages
  instead of HTML generated from exam Markdown.

# Project Rules: markdown-to-qti (Kotlin)

## Scope

- This repository will implement a tool that converts Markdown content into IMS QTI 3.0.
- Prioritize correctness of QTI 3.0 output and a clean internal data model.

## Kotlin / Gradle conventions

- Prefer Kotlin (JVM) with Gradle.
- Keep the entrypoint small; put logic into testable functions/classes.
- Favor immutable data, explicit types at boundaries, and clear error types.

## QTI 3.0 output rules

- Output must be valid QTI 3.0 XML (well-formed, schema-aligned).
- Keep identifiers stable and deterministic (avoid random IDs unless explicitly required).
- When behavior is ambiguous, prefer standards-compliant conservative output and document the decision.

## Markdown conversion behavior

- Define supported Markdown features explicitly (e.g., headings, lists, code blocks, inline formatting).
- If a requested Markdown construct cannot be represented in QTI, do not implement it and explicitly state this in the response.
- Unsupported constructs should fail fast with actionable messages, or be safely downgraded with clear warnings.
- Preserve exact formatting as much as possible when mapping to QTI.

## Testing expectations

- Add unit tests for parsing/mapping rules.
- Add golden tests for QTI XML output (compare normalized XML).
- Include a few end-to-end fixtures (Markdown input -> QTI output) under a dedicated test folder.

## CLI / UX

- Provide a simple CLI with:
  - input path(s)
  - output directory
  - validation mode (validate-only)
  - verbose logging
- Error messages must include the source location when possible (file + line/column).
